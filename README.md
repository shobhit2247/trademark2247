A Trademark Registration is the distinct identification that distinguishes your organisation, product, or service from the competition. A trademark registration is your corporate intellectual property/intangible resource. It protects the investment you've made in establishing confidence and commitment among your customers.
The Trademark Registration gives you the ability to sue anybody who attempts to imitate your trademark and prevents others from using a similar trademark to the one you registered.
 
Why Is Trademark Registration Important?
•	Trademark registration is vital and required for a business since it demonstrates your distinct identity.
•	It contributes to the growth of consumer trust and understanding.
•	It gives constitutional immunity for your brand message.
•	It is a valuable asset in and of itself since it prohibits unlawful use of your brand's name.

Trademark Opposition
A trademark resistance, on the other hand, is a legal action in which one party seeks to prevent a trademark application from being approved. Third parties that believe your trademark may have an influence on them or their own trademark submit a trademark opposition with the trademark examiner in writing, in the form of a notice. If the examiner believes the objection has validity, they must convey the notification to the applicant, who must submit a rebuttal statement to the Registrar within two months.
If the Registrar believes the rebuttal statement adequately answers the issue, the opposition may be dismissed. Alternatively, if the registrar believes there is more to be considered, they may ask for a hearing in which both parties attend and state their cases. Following the hearing, the Registrar will make a decision on the admissibility of either the application or the objection.
